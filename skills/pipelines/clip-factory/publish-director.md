# Publish Director - Clip Factory Pipeline

## When To Use

This stage packages the clip batch into a distribution plan. The goal is not just exported files. The goal is a usable content engine.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["idea"]["brief"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Outputs, rankings, and goals |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Brand voice |

## Process

### 1. Lead With The Strongest Clip

Do not schedule by chronology. Schedule by ranking.

The first published clip should usually be:

- the strongest hook,
- the cleanest standalone clip,
- the clip most aligned with the batch goal.

### 2. Tailor Copy By Platform

Each platform needs its own tone and packaging:

- TikTok / Reels: direct, fast, hook-led
- Shorts: searchable, keyword-aware
- LinkedIn: insight-led and more professional
- X: short, punchy, opinion-friendly

### 3. Package The Batch Cleanly

Group by platform and include ready-to-paste text assets, not just video files.

### 4. Preserve Batch Truth

Store in `publish_log.metadata`:

- `clip_catalog`
- `posting_order`
- `platform_copy_map`
- `schedule_notes`

### 5. Quality Gate

- strongest clips lead the rollout,
- captions are platform-specific,
- export folders are usable without extra cleanup,
- the batch catalog clearly links ranking, file paths, and publishing intent.

## Common Pitfalls

- Publishing the whole batch on the same day.
- Using one caption everywhere.
- Losing the rank/order logic after rendering is complete.

## Export Bundle Gate (Binding)

Package every shipped master with `export_bundle`, after its last `technical_qc` run; never hand-write the export folder or the `publish_log` entry. The tool reads `<master>.qc.json` (or `qc_report_path`) and refuses a master with no report, a report of different bytes, or a `block` verdict. A `warn` verdict ships only with `qc_exception` (`reason` plus the `decision_id` of the `qc_exception` entry in `decision_log`). Any change to the master after the check, `audio_master` included, voids the report: run `technical_qc` again. One `export_bundle` call per master.

<!-- youtube-policy-gate -->
## YouTube Policy Gate

Run the **Publish Checklist** of `skills/meta/youtube-policy-gate.md` and write it to `publish_log.metadata.youtube_policy_checklist`; show it at the approval gate. Upload as private or unlisted first. Captions go up as `.srt` / `.vtt`, never burned into the video.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

<!-- transversal-skills-2026-10 -->
## Transversal Skills (Binding)

Read these before working in this stage. They are shared across pipelines; this file only says when they apply.

- `skills/meta/technical-qc-gate.md` — run `technical_qc` on every render shown to the user and on the final master; `block` stops delivery, every `warn` is opened and resolved. Declare planned silences/holds in `edit_decisions.metadata.intentional_ranges`.
- `skills/core/delivery-specs.md` — destination specs (YouTube, Shorts, Reels, TikTok), one complete version per language, SRT/VTT rules and chapters; never burn subtitles.
- `skills/creative/title-thumbnail-trailer.md` — three honest thumbnail variants, title options, credits and next-episode teaser.

<!-- export-pipeline -->
## Pipeline At Export (Binding)

Pass `pipeline` with this manifest's name to `export_bundle`. The tool refuses an export without it.
