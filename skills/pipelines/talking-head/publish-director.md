# Publish Director — Talking Head Pipeline

## When to Use

You have a render report with the final video. Your job is to prepare metadata, thumbnails, and an export package for publishing.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | Render report, Brief | Video file and context |

## Process

### Step 1: Generate Metadata

Create platform-specific metadata:
- **Title**: Based on the brief's title and hook
- **Description**: Summary of the content with relevant keywords
- **Tags**: Derived from brief's key_points
- **Chapters**: From script section timestamps

### Step 2: Thumbnail Concept

Describe or generate a thumbnail:
- Extract a compelling frame from the footage (if frame_sampler available)
- Add text overlay concept (title or key stat)

### Step 3: Package Export

Create the export directory:
- Video file
- Metadata JSON
- Description text file
- Chapter markers
- Thumbnail concept

### Step 4: Build Publish Log

Document the publish event with platform, status (draft), and export path.

### Step 5: Self-Evaluate

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Metadata quality** | Is the title compelling and description informative? |
| **Completeness** | Is the export package complete? |

### Step 6: Submit

Validate the publish_log against the schema and persist via checkpoint.

## Export Bundle Gate (Binding)

Package every shipped master with `export_bundle`, after its last `technical_qc` run; never hand-write the export folder or the `publish_log` entry. The tool reads `<master>.qc.json` (or `qc_report_path`) and refuses a master with no report, a report of different bytes, or a `block` verdict. A `warn` verdict ships only with `qc_exception` (`reason` plus the `decision_id` of the `qc_exception` entry in `decision_log`). Any change to the master after the check, `audio_master` included, voids the report: run `technical_qc` again. One `export_bundle` call per master.

## YouTube Policy Gate

Run the **Publish Checklist** of `skills/meta/youtube-policy-gate.md` and write it to `publish_log.metadata.youtube_policy_checklist`; show it at the approval gate. Upload as private or unlisted first. Captions go up as `.srt` / `.vtt`, never burned into the video.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## Transversal Skills (Binding)

Read these before working in this stage. They are shared across pipelines; this file only says when they apply.

- `skills/meta/technical-qc-gate.md` — run `technical_qc` on every render shown to the user and on the final master; `block` stops delivery, every `warn` is opened and resolved. Declare planned silences/holds in `edit_decisions.metadata.intentional_ranges`.
- `skills/core/delivery-specs.md` — destination specs (YouTube, Shorts, Reels, TikTok), one complete version per language, SRT/VTT rules and chapters; never burn subtitles.
- `skills/creative/title-thumbnail-trailer.md` — three honest thumbnail variants, title options, credits and next-episode teaser.
